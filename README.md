Caltech-256: Supervised & Unsupervised LearningThis project compares two image learning approaches on the Caltech-256 dataset: Fractal-Regularized Latent Manifold Learning (FRLM) and a highly optimized ResNet-50 supervised baseline.🧠 Approach 1: Unsupervised Learning (FRLM)Model: Custom Convolutional Autoencoder (AE).Goal: Learn high-quality feature representations by enforcing a specific fractal dimension ($D_{target} = 2.5$) in the latent space.Key Innovation: Uses a Differentiable Fractal Loss based on a soft-counted correlation sum, combined with standard MSE Reconstruction Loss.$$L_{total} = L_{MSE} + \lambda \cdot |D_{estimated} - D_{target}|$$Evaluation: The quality of the learned features is assessed via linear probing (training a linear classifier on the frozen AE encoder output).💻 Approach 2: Supervised Learning (Baseline)Model: ResNet-50 (trained end-to-end).Goal: Establish the performance ceiling for full 256-class classification accuracy using state-of-the-art training techniques.Optimization DetailsThe ResNet-50 training was optimized for performance and stability using the following techniques:FixRes (Fixed-Resolution Training): The model was trained at one resolution and fine-tuned/evaluated at a slightly higher one for improved generalization.Mixed Precision Training: Utilized half-precision floating-point numbers (FP16) for faster training and reduced memory consumption.Loss Function: Optimized using Cross-Entropy Loss with Label Smoothing to prevent over-confidence and improve robustness.📊 Results SummaryThe table below summarizes the performance of the feature extractors on the Caltech-256 classification task.MethodParadigmFeature ExtractorAccuracy (Classification)Standard AEUnsupervisedAE Encoder~12.50%Fractal-Regularized AE (Ours)UnsupervisedFRLM EncoderXX.XX%ResNet-50SupervisedEnd-to-End~55.00%🛠️ UsageSetupBashgit clone ...
